## Deploying on Koyeb

To deploy your Telegram bot on Koyeb, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Koyeb Account**: Sign up for a Koyeb account if you haven't already.

2. **Create a New Service**:
   - Log in to your Koyeb dashboard.
   - Click on "Create a Service".

3. **Select Deployment Source**:
   - Choose to deploy from a GitHub repository.
   - Enter the repository URL of your bot.

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - In the Koyeb service settings, add your environment variables. For example, set `BOT_TOKEN` to your actual Telegram bot token.

5. **Create a `Procfile`**:
   - In the root of your repository, create a file named `Procfile` with the following content:
     ```
     web: python main.py
     ```

6. **Health Check Configuration**:
   - Since your bot does not listen to any port, you may need to implement a dummy web server or a health check endpoint to prevent Koyeb from stopping your service. You can use Flask or FastAPI for this purpose.

7. **Deploy Your Application**:
   - After configuring everything, click on "Deploy" in your Koyeb dashboard.
   - Monitor the deployment logs to ensure your application is running correctly.

## Usage

1. Start the bot by sending the `/start` command.
2. Follow the prompts to enter your username, password, and the playlist URL.
3. The bot will download the video and upload it to the chat.
